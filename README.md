# Furniture Donation Organization

# Description
A relational database system to manage furniture donations from donors to recipients, coordinated by volunteers. The project tracks donors, recipients, volunteers, furniture items, donation transactions, and the assignment status of furniture to recipients.
(This project was developed as a team project for a university course.)

# Technologies Used
    - Database: Oracle Database 

    - Language: SQL

    - Tools: Oracle SQL Developer
    
# Features
  - Complete schema with tables, constraints, and relationships

  - Sample data for testing and demonstration

  - Complex business rules enforced via CHECK constraints (e.g., donation date logic, family size limits)

  - Phonе numbers stored in separate tables to support multiple contacts per user

  - Example queries demonstrating:

        1. Filtering with 'LIKE'

        2. Joins across tables

        3. Aggregation with 'GROUP BY' and 'HAVING'

        4. Nested subqueries

        5. Date range filtering with 'BETWEEN' and 'UNION ALL'

        6. Update and delete operations
    
# My Contribution
  - Designed the database schema and created all tables, including Furntiture_item.

  - Wrote all SQL queries (INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE) with complex logic (joins, subqueries, constraints).

  - Added sample data and enforced data integrity rules.
